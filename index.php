		<p>I built birdWalker as a way to collect, organize, and present
		my birding field notes. I wanted to be able to keep track of
		year, county, and life lists without doing very much
        record-keeping by hand.</p>

		<p>If you have bird sightings that you'd like to report,
		please take a look at Cornell University's excellent <a
