The birds were quite acclimated to cars, but flushed immediately when I got out of the car to retrieve something from the trunk. The new binoculars worked out very well. I didn\'t need them to see the pheasants, though -- they stood right on the road and stared at me. I saw something that looked like a Curlew dipped in coal dust, and decided it must have been some kind of Ibis, although the light wasn\'t good enough to see any color details.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A short drive along the river brought me to Gray Lodge Wildlife Refuge, although the number of hunters there made the term \"refuge\" seem a little funny. Apparently, there\'s a lot of people out there who think it\'s fun to camp out in a muddy camping lot on a Monday night in order to put their names in a lottery to earn the right to wander around in the marsh and shoot birds. Myself, I prefer to gaze on them from the comfort of my car, although these birds were a lot more skittish, and even hiding in the car didn\'t stop them from running away. In addition to the plentiful ducks I expected, there was a lovely two-point white-tailed deer, and some kind of marine mammal in a pond. I heard reports from two fellow birders that the Sacramento Wildlife Refuge had lots of vultures and geese, which I didn\'t get to see today -- perhaps I\'ll stop there on the way back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The region containing these two refuges reminded me a lot of central Illinois. Very flat, roads running in straight lines, most of the land consumed by agriculture. Except that you\'d see a flooded field with SEAGULLS sitting in it. That seemed really out of place!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way back to I5, I had the distinct pleasure of crossing the Princeton Ferry -- A platform the size of a large houseboat that pulls itself across the 50 feet of the sluggish Sacramento River for a mere 50 cents. Why not a bridge? I can only assume the river isn\'t always so sluggish, and must vary a lot in depth. Either that or Glenn County doesn\'t have much of a tax base for infrastructure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The drive up to Weed was uneventful. I did pass by an unlit sign saying \"chains required next two miles\" and other sign saying \"summit 3,900 feet\" that reminded me that I\'m _not_ in Illinois.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomorrow -- a marsh just north of here on I97 that is supposed to have lots of raptors and geese and stuff.</p>','1997-11-10');

At BV I did another driving tour, listening to the distant sounds of honking swans from across the lake. There were few other sounds, it was so quiet. On the other side of the road the buffleheads spooked easily, fluttering further down a narrow channel. On my way out of the area I drove within a few yards of a large raptor perched on the side of the road. It might have been an immature eagle of some kind, but I didn\'t think the beak was big enough. I\'m hoping to learn more about raptors on this trip.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I then pretty much drove straght to Sisters, stopping at the occassional gas station on I97, which is definitely a logger\'s highway, not a birder\'s highway. Steve and I ran some errands, had dinner, and sat at his apartment until late looking at his latest photographic endeavors. I\'m staying at the lovely home of Dottie Yurgel, who volunteers at the chamber of commerce. She pointed out that The Tick probably doesn\'t have any anti-freeze and made space in her garage so the radiator might not freeze solid overnight. Winter, Bill, they have Winter here. Duh.

We stood quite still for a long time, overlooking a pond with hundreds of ducks. With little ambient noise, I was able to hear the sound of wind whistling through duck feathers as they swooped into a landing at high speed. I spotted a Merlin, which we later decided is a male Tiega variant. As we were packing everything into the car, Steve spotted a raptor way up high that we decided must be an immature bald eagle. Fantastic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This afternoon I did the McKenzie pass scenic route. The pass itself was otherworldly. Shrouded in fog, the snow covered trees stood watch over the barren, hulking mass of lava boulders. The spindliness of the trees, the absence of other humans, the fog drifting over the terrain and the utter quiet made me feel like the last person on earth. I didn\'t see a single mountain peek through the fog (and there should have been many), but I loved it. I hope the pictures might come out. I also stopped by some waterfalls and greeted them.

Steve Shunk and I were accompanied by Steven Holt,  wildlife photographer and his dog Coot. Mr. Holt and Coot car camp from a Geo Metro that has seen better days. Holt is a charming birder, knowledgeable but not overpowering. He worked at a natural history museum in Philly, curating a collection of bird photographs. I am tempted to order one of his enlargements, perhaps one of his black oystercatcher shots. Along the way to the reservoir we stopped at a river crossing, where we saw the owl sitting quietly in a tree near the river. The reservoir was very foggy and cold. Steve peered at ducks through the scope at maximum magnification, I looked through it and saw only grey. We saw some excellent raptors on power poles along the highway. We saw a dead cow lying on its side in a field, with legs and udders firmly outstretched. We saw ravens feeding on a dead deer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the way home, The Tick rolled over 100,000 miles. And still going strong. Particularly with over 1/2 a gallon of new anti-freeze in its system. Spoon!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the afternoon, I bought wool socks and pens.

We drove past the town of Brothers (town for sale) and stopped for lunch at  Halton Station, where they have coyote pelts for sale, a sheet listing the bail amounts for different traffic offenses, and a bumper sticker near the restroom that says \"paper products are no longer available, just wipe your ass on a spotted owl.\" I ate a grilled chese sandwitch and watched Quincy reruns on satellite TV. The state trooper driving the late model white Camaro stopped in for hot chocolate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By then the terrain was already High Desert, as though I was living in a Tony Hillerman novel. It was expansive, desolate, beautiful. We did a raptor count while driving, and then started another list once we got inside the Refuge. We\'re spending the night in Frenchglen at a bed and breakfast run by Steve\'s friend. Just outside of Frenchglen we stopped at the Buena Vista scenic overlook for some experimental pictures of the (nearly) full moon peeking through the clouds and shining on the marshes. As the moon reappeared from behind the clouds, it seemed to shine as bright as the noontime sun, accompanied by a three-part invention -- the mooing of grumpy cattle, the honking of irrascible geese, and mysterious yowling of coyotes. Something (probably a deer) was walking around in the water, splashing as it went. Sillouettes of ducks crossed through the moon\'s reflection on the water. A beautiful evening.</p>','1997-11-14');

As we were finishing up the sun hit the bottom of the canyon and the trees really came alive. After a hearty breakfast of pancakes, we zoomed up north and started slowly down the central patrol road, stopping frequently. We braved a very windy levy for looks at two kinds of swans. We frowned at idiots who were harrassing a great horned owl. After grabbing our snack food bag, we headed up to the top of Steen mountain, which was clearly covered with snow. We saw Snow Buntings, a life bird for Steve and a really cool find. We didn\'t get to the top of the mountain due to snow drifts, but we took some excellent pictures and generally had an adventure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At dinner I met Steve\'s friend Terry, who is a remarkable man.

Astounding. From the closed refuge headquarters Steve saw a white pelican amongst the far-off swans. A Stellar\'s Jay, dubbed the accidental resident, was still at HQ, despite not being on the official refuge bird list.

The second detour was the Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, which turned out to be an excellent place to see all the geese I didn\'t see up in Oregon. There were thousands of geese and ducks to see from the Auto Tour route, and two very large flocks of shorebirds that wheeled around in unison and landed each time right underneath the setting sun.

Our first serious stop was the rest area on highway 152, which yielded the Greater Road Runner we had been looking for in Panoche on the previous day. We also had nice looks through the scope at waterfowl far below on the reservoir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1000 to 1100</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We stopped in Los Banos for a pit stop and then headed toward the Merced National Wildlife Refuge (NWR). We didn\'t even exit the McDonald\'s parking lot before seeing over a dozen Cattle Egrets, our second life bird of the day. We spotted quite a few raptors on power poles and other birds on fences while en route to the NWR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1100 to 1400</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We spotted a wonderful Great Horned Owl just as we turned into the Merced NWR on our way to the parking lot. After pausing to look over the water from the parking lot, we slowly wound our way through the auto tour route, using walkie-talkies to relay information back and forth between cars. Although we didn\'t see the vast flocks of geese and cranes one might hope for, we did see some excellent ducks and raptors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1400 to 1630</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to try our luck at the nearby San Luis NWR, where another auto tour route took us right past a lovely American Bittern. Some stubborn folks tracked a high altitude soaring raptor, which turned out to be a Bald Eagle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1630 to 1700</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We decided to squeeze in one last stop at the San Joaquin dam, where we enjoyed the sunset and scanned our scopes across the water. A restful end to a very full day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the day we saw some excellent mammals and farm creatures, including:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>coyote - healthy and happy looking 20 feet from the car\r\n<li>vole - not so healthy - he was being eaten and swallowed whole by a great egret. Great show. Wish we had it on tape to watch agan and again.\r\n<li>cows - Cows, cows, cows\r\n<li>emu - just one. Must be an experiment or a pet.\r\n<li>sheep - several breeds intermixed, but mostly looked like eatin\' sheep, not spinnin\' sheep\r\n<li>sheepdog - you never saw a happier animal\r\n<li>house cat - with dark shoulders and a white breast, sitting right where we expected to find hawks. It\'s always funny when you\'re trying to turn a mammal into some specialty bird.</p>','2001-01-14');

It is our largest single day species total ever. Here\'s how the day unfolded:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4:45am Clock radio turns on. Ugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4:50am Alarm clock goes off. Ugh.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5:00am Found the list I wrote myself last night about what to do this morning, with helpful items like \"feed cat\" and \"eat breakfast\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5:30am On our way to Dick\'s house</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6:00am We\'re in Dick\'s car, headed for the coast. The new plan is to hit the coast first, then work back toward the bay side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6:45am In the pre-dawn overcast we spot our first species -- a Great Horned Owl posing out in the open on a telephone wire. It seems an auspicous start to the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7:30am, Pigeon Point Lighthouse. A huge raft of Common Murres floats serenely as dozens of cormorants speed by. No warblers in the trees near the hostel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8:20am On the way to Gazos Creek we spot our first of eight or ten Red-shouldered Hawks for the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9:00am, Gazos Creek Road. We\'ve hit the warbler jackpot! These trees are teeming with chickadees, vireos, warblers. After much debate, we decide that we\'re seeing both Warbling and Philadelphia Vireo.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10:00am, Ano Neuvo State Park. Dick leads us in the secret back way to a beach overlook were we are greeted by one of the largest flocks of Western and Clark\'s Grebes any of us can remember.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11:00am On our way to Pescadero Beach, we pull of the road to look at a raptor, and notice a dozen Tricolored Blackbirds posing conveniently on the telephone wire directly overhead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11:40am Immediately upon setting up the spotting scope at Pescadero Beach, eight mergansers hove into view around a bend in the creek. We decide its lunch time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1:00pm We\'ve finished lunch at Duarte\'s in Pescadero, and are much revived by the Cream of Artichoke Soup. We\'ve seen over sixty species before lunch, and are feeling good about hitting our goal of one hundred species today. Before returning to Pescadero Marsh, we drive around the town itself. During a brief roadside stop, Mary and Bill see their first Pygmy Nuthatch. A local birder invites to stop by her delightful garden, where we get great looks at Say\'s Phoebe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2:30pm, Pescadero Marsh. There are only four kinds of ducks here, but we\'ve also rounded out our list of herons and egrets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3:00pm Mezza Luna. Dick introduces to the famous \"Mezza Luna Willows\" behind the restraurant in Princeton-by-the-Sea. These trees, like the ones at Gazos Creek, are teeming with life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4:00pm, Pillar Point Harbor. Finally, some Terns! We add Elegant Tern and Surf Scoter to the list and decide to head back over the hills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5:30pm, Redwood Shores Radio Towers. Dick is right, this pond is amazing at high tide. Amongst hundreds of Godwits, Dowitchers, and Curlews, Dick shows Mary and Bill their first Red Knot outside of the Monterey Bay Aquarium aviary. We also enjoy great looks at Pectoral Sandpiper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6:15pm Another unlikely but crowded pond is located directly behind the Silicon Valley Athletic Club. We add American White Pelican to the list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7:00pm As the sunlight fades, we stop at the East Palo Alto Baylands, one of Dick\'s favorite bicycle destinations. We round out our list at 115 species with the distinctive calls of Clapper Rail and Sora.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a day!</p>','2001-09-23');

I\'m bad with the sub-species, but the heads looked square rather than round, and one of the birds had a clear white neck ring nearly as tall as the base of the bill.  This looks like Aleutian to me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a LINCOLN\'S SPARROW on what my friend Bob calls \"the Magic Brush Pile\" next to the boathouse on Merced at 10:30.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Golden Gate Park, we saw 3 WHITE-THROATED SPARROWs One on the north end Stowe Lake Hill at 11:30, seen by the rest of the party, but not by me, flew from Strawberry Hill to the shore.   And two by the bathrooms next to the path by North Lake - one adult and one immature, both tan stripe morph.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a female HOODED MERGANSER on the left side of the curvy brush at Middle Lake.  The bird was preening, standing on a branch, with her back to us and a clear view of her brown crest drooping over her grey nape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last are a couple I think is probably not interesting.. but I don\'t know the score in San Francisco. Two female RING-NECKED DUCKS flew into Lake Merced around 4 pm, landing in open water between the metal boardwalk and the skeet shooting range.  They had very bright white crescents near the bill, somewhat indistinct face markings around the eye and white around the bill, just behind the tip.  We saw a single female CANVASBACK at Lake Merced around 4:15 pm.  She was with a group of Mallards and Coots in the area between the stone bridge and the metal boardwalk, near the porta-potty.</p>','2004-01-17');
